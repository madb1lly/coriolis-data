# About

This fork was created to avoid messing up the main coriolis-data project. The fork will be used for learning about the Coriolis project with the intention of eventually contributing. Any contributions to this project will not go to the main Coriolis project. If anyone wants to contribute to the Coriolis project they should contribute directly to https://github.com/EDCD/coriolis-data.

Coriolis was created using assets and imagery from Elite: Dangerous, with the permission of Frontier Developments plc, for non-commercial purposes. It is not endorsed by nor reflects the views or opinions of Frontier Developments and no employee of Frontier Developments was involved in the making of it.
